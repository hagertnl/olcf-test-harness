====================
Adding a New Machine
====================

The following steps can be used to add support for a new system:

1. Create a machine configuration file (e.g. *lyra.ini*, placed in *$OLCF_HARNESS_DIR/configs/lyra.ini*).
2. Create the location of the repository that will hold all applications and tests for that particular machine
    - This can be in a remote Git repository, or a directory on the file system (which is then used as **Path_to_tests** in the input file)

Creating a new machine configuration file is discussed below.
The creation of new tests is discussed in :ref:`section_new_test`.


Create a Basic Machine Configuration
------------------------------------

An example input file with detailed explanation is contained below.
All settings in the *machine.ini* file are used to set environment variables that can be used throughout the test.
For example, **gpus_per_node** is used to set **RGT_GPUS_PER_NODE**, which could be used in a job script.
These settings do not override existing environment variables.
If **RGT_SCHEDULER_TYPE** is set by the user, then the *machine.ini* file will not override it.

    # A string that can be used to identify tests run for a specific purpose (ie: 'summit_tshot_cuda11')
    system_log_tag = frontier_test


.. note::

    These variables can all be overridden by setting **RGT_<VARIABLE_NAME>** in the environment prior to launching.
    However, that usage of **batch_queue**/**RGT_BATCH_QUEUE** and **project_id**/**RGT_PROJECT_ID** may be incorrect.
    For handling these variables, please see :ref:`runtime_configurable_parameters`.
